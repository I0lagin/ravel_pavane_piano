LM and Harano Aji fonts are personal preferences (same fonts as upLaTeX)

- m17: top crescendo overlaps with slur
- m54:
	- beginning of grace notes (b) not overlapping with normal note (b)
	- can't emulate ties from graces (skill issue)
	- where's the "6" supposed to go?
- m55: grace note position incorrect?
- m60~: 16th note grouping incorrect
